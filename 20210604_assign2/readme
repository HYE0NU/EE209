Q.  Is it possible for StrCopy to call assert to verify that the
    destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough?

A.  It is not possible. 
    We can verify the size of destination memory area in 
    limited situations, like the case its length parameter is given
    or it is 'clearly' terminated(by NULL character, ...).
    As there is no guarantee that 
    destination is not garbage data or filled(cleared) with '\0',
    we cannot check if the destination memory area 
    is large enough in StrCopy function.

implementation method: 
    pointer notation (for extra credit)
