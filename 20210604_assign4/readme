Additional Information
    The program recognizes the command if the command is 
    in front of input stream.
        ex) p123 considered as 'p' command
            123p considered as input 123

    Program crashes if user tries division by zero.

    Cannot handle overflow/underflow. (but does not crash)
    Input and Output should be in range of int type 
    for proper calculation.
